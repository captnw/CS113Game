# Leroy the Chef Spider: Spice Chronicles
Leroy the Chef Spider: Spice Chronicles is a charming and cartoonish single player Unity 2-D platformer where players will get to jump (and stick) around as our beloved spider, Leroy, and explore his tiny and terrifying world through various complex levels. Each level features different surfaces, obstacles, and enemies that Leroy will need to navigate through in an attempt to collect all the Spices on the level and reach the exit as fast as possible.
